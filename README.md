# Overview

this is a tic tac toe program that allows 2 people on diffrent devices play tic tac toe with each other. one person starts the server, and the other joins with the client. after that the progam will just run asking the one progam for an input then the other.

the purpose of writing this software was for me to gain an understanding computer networking so if I ever had to use it I would know how to.
